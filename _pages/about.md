I am currently a Fourth year Statistic Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago under the supervision of [Professor Veronika Rockova](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/veronika.rockova/) and [Professor John Reinitz](https://galton.uchicago.edu/faculty/reinitz.shtml). 

My research interests are a nice mix of Statistical Theory, Methodology and Applications. With a particular applications to System Biology and genomics. Currently, I am working on Approximation Bayesian Computations and Deep Learning models in genomics and system biology.
