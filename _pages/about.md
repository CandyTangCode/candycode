Hi, I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon. Currently, I work for the Core AI team. 

I did my Ph.D. at the University of Chicago (Statistics Department) under the supervision of [Professor Veronika Rockova](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/veronika.rockova/) and [Professor John Reinitz](https://galton.uchicago.edu/faculty/reinitz.shtml). There, my research interests are a nice mix of Statistical Theory, Methodology and Applications. With a particular applications to System Biology and genomics. Currently, I am working on Approximation Bayesian Computations and Deep Learning models in genomics and system biology.
