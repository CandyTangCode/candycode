We look at the case for non-parametric variable selection. This is a hard problem. However, from this we discover an Approximate Bayesian Computation [solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02304) to the problem. 

In a new attempt to study this problem, we look at an improve in the speed of our ABC algorithm. For this, we make use of Thompson Sampling. The result is a new algorithm called Thompson Variable Selection listed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00187).
