Dear Readers of my technical blogpost, if you ever have the chance to come to this point. Well, first thing, thanks for coming to my blog series where I have decided to write about what I read over the years and pick out something interesting. I have done similar work before but it failed partially due to the fact that I was not able to be productive. In fact, I am pretty bad and maintaining something with positive feedback so maybe I will share this work on Medium or whatever platform neccesary to maintain a positive feedback loop. At the moment, I am thinking about just making this as a piece of notetaker for the papers that I have read. I will summarize the ideas in the paper but I will try not to comment on the work unless I have the oppportunity to play with properly. This blog series will mainly focus on 

* Development of AI space, Applied or Theoretical
* Development of Macro-economics indicators as it relates to AI 
* Development of Statistics, Theoretical or Applied 
* Some of my own work

Lets see how this will work out in the future. If it works well, then I will work on adding some more stuff.
