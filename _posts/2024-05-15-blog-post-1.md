If one looks very carefully at how diffusion models equation is written down. It is very clear that there is connection between Bayesian Posterior and current diffusion Model. In Bayesian Statistics, we have $\theta \sim \pi(\theta)$ and ${\bf X} = \{x_1,\cdots x_T\} \sim f(x\mid \theta)$

$ f(\theta \mid {\bf X})  \propto f({\bf X} \mid \theta )\pi(\theta) =  \prod_{t=1}^T f(X_t\mid X_{t-1}\cdots X_1 \mid \theta) \pi(\theta)$ 


Now, lets move this a
