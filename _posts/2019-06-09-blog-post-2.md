This review is regarding the paper on 'Basset: Learning the regulatory code of the accessible genome with deep
convolutional neural networks.' by Kelley, David, Snoek, Jasper and Rinn, John. The link to the paper is [here](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2016/05/03/gr.200535.115.full.pdf+html) 

The work generally focus on constructing a non-parametric model that accurately learn 'the relevant sequence motifs and the regulatory logic with which they are combined to determine cell specific DNA accessiblity' (Kelley 2016).

What I think is interesting is that the initial convolution layer is PWM matrices which I would agree is really ideal for finding binding site. The cut off which they use (i.e 0 ) by the ReLU function essentially correspond to the 0.5 being the probability that there is binding site in there. The rest of the layers are much more focused on conventional Deep Learning technique with a more heuristic interpretation of what is going on. However, there is 300 convolutional filter in this model. More than enough (I think) to capture the underlying relationship between binding sites.
