Just read through a paper from Arxiv. This topic is very interesting. "High order theory of mind": the human ability to reason about
multiple mental and emotional states in a recursive manner (e.g. I think that you believe that she knows). This step by step recursive reasoning should be what AI are good at since they should be good at recursively applying the same logic. The issue is to save within the AI framework, any mid-results that is found. 

In addition to the concept that is being studied, the experiment is interesting since it propose a new set of questions for AI to answer. This can be an interesting new benchmark for AI to study in the future.
