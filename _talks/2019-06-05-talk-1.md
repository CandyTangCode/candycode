This talk is class presentation for Computational Biology Class. However the content of the talk focuses on my recent work in [Fully Interpretable Deep Learning Model of Transcriptional Control](https://yiliu9090.github.io//publication/2019-05-23-Fully-Interpretable-Deep-Learning-Model-of-Transcriptional-Control)

The slides [link](yiliu9090.github.io/files/Presentation_of_Computational_Biology.pdf) will includes some basics about Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network.
